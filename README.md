# Infrapulse 

**Infrapulse** is a collection of Python scripts that interact with AWS services using [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html), AWS's official Python SDK. The application features a Text User Interface (TUI) built with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), providing an interactive terminal-based dashboard for AWS resource management. This is a study project with the purpose of learning and experimenting with AWS resource management via API calls, as well as diving deeper into Python programming.
